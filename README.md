# thesisDerivation
This is an animation of our derivation for conductivity and dielectric constant as a function of impedance in idealized granular systems. These functions can be used to calculate these material properties from measurements taken using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).   This animation was created using manim (mathematical animation), a free and open-source animation tool pioneered by Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown fame, and further developed by the community the sprung up around it. More information, including downloads, can be found here: https://github.com/3b1b/manim.  This animation was created for my Honors Thesis Defense in Spring 2022 at the Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy, UNC-Chapel Hill, where I research in Dr. Yue Wu's material science lab. A published paper with our results is forthcoming. In the meantime, have a look at Patrick Doyle's dissertation, which my thesis builds on: https://doi.org/10.17615/fw2y-9179.
